This is the repository for learning before entering Tsing Hua University for a master degree

Hi everyoneÔºÅ

Allyson here. I am glad that I passed the summer camp of Tsing Hua University. Considering that I might need some python and machine learning kownledge for my next phD degree, I create this repository to document my learning process. Hope I can stick to it.
